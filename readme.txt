The Matprat plugin allows you to control which posts appear on the Matprat portal.

== Installation ==

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

1. Upload the complete 'matprat-share' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory OR install via the plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it, now when creating a post, you will see some extra options for controlling the category and title etc. used on Matprat.no.
